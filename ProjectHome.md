Paperquake is an Actionscript 3 library for parsing Quake1 maps.

The Quake1 map files (**.bsp) are not included**, as I'm not sure whether any licensing applies to the maps.

Open source PAK's available here: [OpenQuartz](http://openquartz.sourceforge.net/pak0/index.html).

Also see the [Quake 2 library](http://code.google.com/p/paperquake2/).
